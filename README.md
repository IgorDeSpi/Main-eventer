## Goal project
For this project, we needed to learn how to work as a team, organize our work for us but the others too. But work in team was not the only thing to learn, we needed to be as close as possible of the model to satisfy the customer. All that with keeping in mind semantics and good code practice of course.

## How did we do it?
* We distribute the different parts between us but help each other when we faced a problem.
* We decide to comment the code relatively early for an easier merge near the end.
* We exchange little bit of code like the font colors.
* When we merged, we did it in vocal and with screen sharing.

## Difficulties

Merge was easy and not. Communicate what we needed was a bit tricky because each mind work differently. It's a process to learn and it'll take time and practice.
